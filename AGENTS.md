# Guidelines

- Use Bun 1.3.14 for repository commands and keep the authored Markdown compatible with Obsidian and ordinary text tooling.
- Treat this repository as the complete project. Files and Git prose may use only its public names, paths, commands, and examples; do not refer to or infer a non-public source repository.
- Keep Markdown authoritative and graph maintenance deterministic and local-first. Derive focused metadata, backlink, traversal, and percolation views directly from the current files; never commit a second graph database, event log, or generated fact file.
- Keep concepts as ordinary `type: concept` notes and source-owned typed relationships as compact frontmatter. Never write reciprocal, inferred, transitive, or similarity-derived edges into notes.
- Keep QMD state optional, local, dynamically loaded, and rebuildable from Markdown. The default hybrid path may combine local full-text and vector ranks, but query expansion and reranking remain opt-in costs. Join every match to current authored metadata and graph state.
- Pin required QMD compatibility behavior to an immutable public Hraness fork commit. Verify the installed bytes in focused tests and update or return to upstream only when equivalent store-local model behavior is published.
- Keep exact matches and QMD results inspectable as separate retrieval evidence. Return graph neighbors and Git history as context and provenance, not silent relevance boosts, authored links, or inferred facts.
- Keep `@hraness/kb/evaluation-builder` as the cohesive public boundary for frozen-corpus authoring, evidence compilation, implementation commitments, seal validation, and v2 evaluation mechanics. Keep repository-specific corpora, configurations, retriever descriptors, and promotion expectations in the consumer.
- Treat a code-mode session as a read-only snapshot that shares one vault scan. Reopen it after Markdown changes. Validate workflow DAGs before execution, cap nodes and concurrency, serialize QMD nodes, and bound Git workers below the global limit.
- Keep bundled workflows free of hidden writes and process-global state. Require explicit vault and repository inputs and return structured results that agents can inspect or compose.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` normative and always loaded for ownership, prohibitions, required commands, invariants, and gates. Optional `type: agent-context` hubs under `scopes/` are pull-based rationale, history, examples, evidence, and links; they cannot override a guide or become the sole home of a load-bearing edit rule.
- Derive every scope-hub identity from the full exact repository-relative directory scope, with `.` for the root, and require one reciprocal `kb:context` marker before the mapped guide's headings. Unmapped guides remain valid; moving a scope changes identity.
- Confine repository-context lookup and agent-guide audits to the selected repository. Require real scope directories and regular guide files, reject collisions and symlinked mappings, skip generated or vendor directories, and never follow symbolic-link directories.
- Treat `repository_scopes` as exact case-sensitive authored paths. Match directories lexically to descendants, match files only to themselves, report existence separately from validity, and never infer or rewrite scopes from Git history.
- Treat agent-guide length, long-bullet, inherited-chain, and exact-duplicate audit findings as deterministic advisories rather than correctness. Keep required edit-time rules in the guide even when they exceed a suggested budget.
- Derive backlinks from explicit wikilinks and typed relationships. Keep both authored and managed front doors navigational, never inject reciprocal links, and leave title, alias, inbox, and percolation candidates advisory until their evidence is reviewed.
- Keep parallel note edits sharded by source file. Serialize same-note local writers, make replacements atomic and revision-checked, let edit lanes check graph policy without refreshing a catalog, and reserve the single managed catalog write for integration. An authored catalog mode must never rewrite the front door.
- Restrict generated edits to marked, tool-owned regions; preserve concurrent authored changes when refreshing; and fail closed on malformed markers, unsafe paths, or invalid local attachments.
- Treat capture inputs and outputs as hostile. Keep network, browser, subprocess, byte, item, depth, path, credential, and terminal boundaries bounded and covered by named regressions.
- Keep the six `skills/` directories byte-identical between the repository and packed package. They remain inert after installation and must be usable from `node_modules/@hraness/kb/skills/` without a source checkout.
- Keep Archive.today-family discovery read-only and exactly bound to the requested source URL at every redirect hop. Preserve useful structured provider results ahead of archive fallback, and keep search-derived metadata in a separately owned sidecar with categorical provenance and failure states. Resolve fixed search-engine hosts through the public-network boundary, disable redirects, serialize engines, and confine the helper's process memory.
- Keep security-sensitive runtime forks pinned to immutable commits and exercise their behavior through the standalone install gate.
- Pair concrete behavior tests with property tests for parsing, resolution, ordering, path confinement, and round-trip laws.
- Run `bun test src/benchmark.test.ts src/evaluation.test.ts src/evaluation-kb.test.ts src/search.test.ts src/sdk.test.ts` when changing rank fusion, retrieval defaults, frozen-corpus execution, or built-in evaluation adapters. The six-case synthetic rank-fusion fixture is a deterministic regression, not a retrieval-quality or performance benchmark. Keep real-corpus manifests versioned, judgments independent of rankings, raw lane evidence intact, and performance claims tied to named hardware and measured runs. Run `bun run check` before handing off a change; it must leave committed `dist/` and `bun.lock` unchanged.
- Treat a `v*` tag as a release request, not a completed release. Before tagging, confirm repository-level immutable releases are enabled; use a strictly increasing stable package version, keep the tag equal to `v<package.json version>` on `main`, and let the read-only verification job complete before its write-scoped publisher creates the Release. Do not create the next tag until that workflow and Release are verified because GitHub concurrency is not a durable queue. After tagging, verify the matching non-draft immutable Release is Latest.
