# Capture web content

`kb clip` saves public and signed-in web content as an auditable Markdown bundle. It combines bounded structured adapters, HTTP extraction, browser rendering, a read-only Archive.today fallback, localized assets, and explicit completeness metadata.

## Check local capabilities

Run the diagnostics before using local search, browser state, PDF ingestion, or video capture:

```sh
kb doctor
kb adapters
```

`kb doctor --json` reports the installed runtime, QMD and static semantic-search
prerequisites, extraction dependencies, browser support, profile display names,
yt-dlp, ffmpeg, Poppler (`pdfinfo` and `pdftohtml`), and Tesseract. The semantic
report distinguishes model-free keyword readiness from SQLite and sqlite-vec
vector prerequisites; it does not inspect or download the embedding model. The
Poppler pair is required by `kb pdf`; Tesseract adds local OCR for scans and
screenshots.
`kb adapters --json` returns the current platform capability matrix.

## Capture or inspect a page

```sh
kb clip https://example.com/article
kb inspect https://example.com/article
kb inspect https://example.com/article --json
```

The default route tries stable public structured data when available, bounded HTTP extraction, and a rendered browser when the platform or result requires one. If those routes produce no usable representation, KB may make one read-only lookup for the exact URL through Archive.today's fixed `archive.ph/newest/` route. An authentication, paywall, CAPTCHA, access-control, or rate-limit response disables that fallback instead of using an archive to bypass the current source's controls. KB never submits the URL for archiving, retries through aliases, or lets archived HTML displace a complete or partial Hacker News or Bluesky structured capture. It validates the source through the public-network boundary before disclosure, shares one deadline across validation and provider requests, and binds every snapshot and redirect to the exact source. An archived result is rescored and always reported as `partial`; it keeps the original canonical URL and records the timestamped snapshot as its acquisition URL. Inspection returns the selected Markdown and capture report without writing artifacts.

By default, a capture writes `kb/articles/<slug>/`:

```text
<slug>/
  <slug>.md
  capture.json
  url-metadata.json # after an optional metadata backfill
  assets/
  evidence/       # only when requested
```

The Markdown records source and capture metadata. `capture.json` records the acquisition attempts, selected extractor, scope, status, item counts, warnings, asset hashes, and requested artifact outcomes. The optional `url-metadata.json` is a separate tool-owned enrichment record. It does not rewrite acquisition provenance in `capture.json`. Writes stage beside the target and install with an atomic rename. `--force` replaces only a compatible clip-owned bundle and restores the previous bundle if installation fails.

Set `KB_CLIP_OUTPUT` to change the default output root, or pass `--output <directory>` for one command. Set `KB_CLIP_USER_AGENT` or pass `--user-agent <value>` to override the default request user agent.

## Select acquisition and scope

```sh
kb clip https://example.com/article --mode http
kb clip https://example.com/application --mode browser
kb clip https://example.com/post --scope page
kb clip https://example.com/post --scope thread
kb clip https://example.com/discussion --scope comments
```

`auto` is the normal acquisition mode. `http` disables browser fallback but retains the final read-only archive lookup. `browser` requires rendered state and does not query Archive.today. Saved HTML can be imported without browser automation:

```sh
kb clip https://example.com/article --html "$KB_SAVED_HTML"
kb clip https://example.com/article --html - < page.html
```

Default resource bounds are 30 seconds per request, process, or extraction operation; 500 scoped items; depth 16; 25 MB of HTML; 100 MB per asset; and 500 MB across assets. Browser observation also has fixed DOM and scroll ceilings. Reaching a bound is recorded and can downgrade a result to `partial`.

## Capture images, media, and evidence

```sh
kb clip https://example.com/article --media none
kb clip https://example.com/article --media images
kb clip https://example.com/video --media all
kb clip https://example.com/article --evidence source
kb clip https://example.com/article --evidence screenshot
kb clip https://example.com/article --evidence all
```

Image downloads are signature-checked, content-addressed, byte-bounded, and
rewritten to relative bundle paths. Failed images remain inert links. Video
posters and thumbnails exposed by the page are localized without downloading
the full video.

For YouTube, the normal capture route uses yt-dlp to retain the title,
description, duration, channel, thumbnail, and one exact-language transcript
when those fields are available. Full audio/video download remains opt-in:
`--media all` invokes yt-dlp for accessible media, and ffmpeg may be required
for merging or remuxing.

Source evidence is sanitized into inert HTML with credential-shaped values redacted and a deny-all content security policy. Screenshots are viewport-only pixels and are not structurally sanitized. They may contain private content or notifications, so review them before retaining or sharing a bundle.

## Capture a signed-in page

If the page is already open, read the current tab without navigating it:

```sh
kb clip current --browser-live
kb clip current --cdp 9222
```

For `--browser-live`, first enable Chrome's local debugging connection at `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` (Chrome 144+). If Chrome was launched with an explicit loopback debugging port, pass that numeric port to `--cdp` instead.

To open a URL with existing browser state, select a profile name or path. Path-backed profiles run from a temporary copy, so the source profile is unchanged:

```sh
kb clip https://example.com/member/article --browser-profile "$KB_CAPTURE_PROFILE"
```

Cookie-backed HTTP capture is useful when the page does not require local storage, IndexedDB, or other browser-only state:

```sh
kb clip https://example.com/member/article --cookie-source chrome --cookie-profile "Default"
kb clip https://example.com/member/article --cookies-file "$KB_COOKIES_FILE"
```

Choose at most one browser session and one cookie input. A browser session may use a separate cookie input for later asset or media downloads because attached browser state is not exported.

Current-tab capture issues no navigation, click, form, typing, upload, or submit command. URL-based browser capture may navigate and scroll within fixed work limits, taking bounded observations as content is rendered. Both routes are ingestion-only: they do not post, like, follow, send, delete, or submit.

## Interpret status and counts

Capture status is one of:

- `complete`: the selected bounded representation was acquired without a known missing boundary.
- `partial`: useful content was retained, but a count, cursor, configured bound, hidden branch, or generic rendered representation prevents a completeness claim.
- `auth-required`: the selected routes reached an authentication gate.
- `blocked`: the source returned a block or verification shell.
- `unsupported`: no route produced a usable representation.

For page scope, counts cover primary entries. For thread and comment scopes, counts cover replies or comments and exclude roots, quotes, ancestors, and pagination markers. Generic rendered conversations often report `capturedItems: 0` because visible prose does not prove a trustworthy per-item tree.

A `complete` or `partial` capture exits with status 0. Authentication, blocked, and unsupported outcomes use status 3. Argument errors use status 2, environment diagnostic failures use status 4, and operational errors use status 1. Automation should inspect the structured status and warnings rather than relying only on the process exit code.

## Platform routes

- Hacker News uses the official Firebase item API for bounded recursive discussions.
- Bluesky uses public AT Protocol resolution and thread APIs.
- Reddit first tries its unofficial public listing JSON and falls back when that surface is denied or changes.
- X uses article extraction plus rendered capture; unloaded or virtualized replies remain partial.
- Substack uses article extraction and a signed-in browser for subscriber text when selected.
- GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions use the Defuddle GitHub extractor, with a signed-in browser fallback for private repositories.
- Discourse topics use the Defuddle Discourse extractor and rendered fallback.
- YouTube adds bounded yt-dlp video context—title, description, duration,
  channel, thumbnail, and an available exact-language transcript—to HTTP or
  rendered page capture. Full audio/video remains opt-in with `--media all`.
- Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, Threads, WhatsApp Web, and arbitrary
  applications use rendered or saved-HTML capture. They do not gain a
  trustworthy item tree without a dedicated adapter.

Platform markup and endpoints change. Run `kb adapters` for the installed version's current claims.

## Backfill saved URL metadata

The URL metadata command enriches every external URL record under `articles/`, including legacy web clips and remote PDF sources. It skips local-only PDFs. It writes one sibling `url-metadata.json` without changing the source Markdown or synthesizing an old capture manifest.

Build the isolated Rust helper, then run the resumable backfill:

```sh
kb url-metadata tool build
kb url-metadata backfill --root .
```

The helper pins [`MikeLuu99/searxng-rust`](https://github.com/MikeLuu99/searxng-rust) at revision `f40a00ea67a857ee996e1caba1ebab3ee7a14a47`. Its crate is named `metadata-search-engine-rs`; it queries DuckDuckGo, Brave, Startpage, and Yahoo and combines their results. KB resolves those four fixed hosts through its public-network boundary, passes only the validated addresses to the helper, disables redirects, and runs the upstream engines serially. A bounded global allocator caps Rust-owned response buffers and parsed data at 128 MiB. Linux also applies a 256 MiB process data ceiling. macOS rejects a lowered `RLIMIT_DATA`, so it retains the allocator ceiling plus the parent's subprocess deadline and output bounds. KB passes requests over stdin to a private subprocess with ambient proxy and credential variables removed, bounds the subprocess deadline and output, parses the closed response itself, and does not use the upstream URL normalizer for saved identity.

This operation discloses each eligible source URL as an exact search query to those search engines. Archive discovery also discloses it to Archive.today. Before either request, KB resolves the source host through its public-network boundary and rejects credential-bearing URLs, private targets, and credential-shaped query parameters. Safe identity parameters such as Hacker News `item?id=` and YouTube `watch?v=` remain part of the exact query.

Only a result with the same conservative URL identity can supply the selected title or description. A timestamped Archive.today result must embed that same source identity before it can be recorded. Provider failures, partial engine coverage, throttling, and absence remain explicit in the sidecar. A zero-result record is `not-found` only after complete attempted coverage; any failed engine or archive lookup keeps the top-level result `partial`.

The command skips compatible sidecars by default. Use `--refresh` to query them again, `--no-archive` to omit Archive.today discovery, or `--delay-ms` to change the default one-second interval between outbound requests. It reads Markdown and sidecars through validated no-follow descriptors, carries the source Markdown and article-directory identities through provider work, and revalidates them under an inode-bound kernel advisory lock immediately before atomic installation. A live writer's lock cannot be stolen. The kernel releases a crashed writer's lock, and the next run safely reuses its verified lock file while UUID-scoped temporary names prevent an orphan from blocking progress. Malformed, linked, mismatched, replaced, or concurrently changed sources, locks, and sidecars fail closed.
